Since 1970 more than **120** string matching algorithms have been proposed. In this diagram shown almost all of them. The list is updated to **May 2016**. From [Exact Online String Matching Bibliography](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.05067.pdf)

**Try: zoom, drag diagram below ðŸ‘‡ or hover, click nodes.**

## About demo

This demo is to show the potential of modern Jamstack and alternative ideas for publishing Second Brain / Digital Garden.

### Markdown as "graph" database

- Data for timeline directly queried from markdown files. No need to maintain a separate file.
- Connection between nodes automatically discovered based on links (markdown links or wiki links).

### No JS diagram

- Diagram fully generated on the server (at build time in case of Jamstack). So it works even without JS - no need for Mermaid or d3 on the client
- Diagram is embedded SVG, which allows
  - to add HTML links to it
  - style it with CSS classes, for example, to add dark theme support

### Progressively enhanced diagram

On top of static SVG, there is a small JS added to:

- to allow drag/zoom diagram
- to show HTML reach snippets when the user hovers over a node
  - snippet is HTML page generated based on markdown from the file
